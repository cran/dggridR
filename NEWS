dggridR v3.1.0 
===============
* Fixed a numeric precision issue on Apple silicon computers (#63)
* Removed dplyr, rlang and sp as dependencies to make the package more 
  lightweight and up to date (sp is depreciated)
* Added collapse and s2 as dependencies (incurring 0 additional dependencies) 
  yielding significant performance gains, especially in grid materialization
* Function dgshptogrid now also allows passing an sf data frame in memory, 
  in addition to a shapefile saved to disc
* Functions dgcellstogrid, dgearthgrid, dgrectgrid and dgshptogrid now have an 
  additional argument return_sf = TRUE. Setting return_sf = FALSE gives a more
  memory efficient long data frame with the coordinates of the cell vertices.
* These changes were made by Sebastian Krantz
